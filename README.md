This sample project shows how to convert from screen to world coordinates while using a camera component. The conversion is made in the `screen_to_world(camera, x, y, z)` function in `camera.lua`.

The project also shows how the `screen_to_world()` function can be used to anchor game objects to the corners of the screen regardless of screen resolution and aspect ratio.
